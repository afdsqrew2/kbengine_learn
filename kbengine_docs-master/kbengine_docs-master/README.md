## What is KBEngine?
An open source MMOG server engine. 
Just use Python scripting to be able to complete any game logic simply and efficiently (supports hotfixing).
Various KBEngine plugins can be quickly combined with (Unity3D, OGRE, Cocos2d-x, HTML5, etc.) technology to 
form a complete game client.

The engine is written in C++, and saves developers from having to re-implement common server-side 
technology, allowing them to concentrate on game logic development, to quickly create a variety of games.

(Because it is often asked what the upper limit of the load is that KBEngine can handle, the underlying 
architecture has been designed as a multi-process distributed dynamic load balancing solution. In theory, 
by continuously expanding the hardware, the upper limit of the load can also be continuously increased. 
The upper limit of the capacity of a single machine depends on the complexity of the game logic itself.)

## 什么是KBEngine?
一款开源的游戏服务端引擎，使用简单的约定协议就能够使客户端与服务端进行交互，
使用KBEngine插件能够快速与(Unity3D, OGRE, Cocos2d, HTML5, 等等)技术结合形成一个完整的客户端。

服务端底层框架使用c++编写，游戏逻辑层使用Python(支持热更新)，开发者无需重复的实现一些游戏服务端通用的底层技术，
将精力真正集中到游戏开发层面上来，快速的打造各种网络游戏。

(经常被问到承载上限，kbengine底层架构被设计为多进程分布式动态负载均衡方案，
理论上只需要不断扩展硬件就能够不断增加承载上限，单台机器的承载上限取决于游戏逻辑本身的复杂度。)
